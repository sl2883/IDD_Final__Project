# Interactive tabletop game of tic-tac-toe

#### Team
1. Ankit Malhan
2. Sunny Ladkani

#### Idea
When we are in the social settings, such as a restaurant, we tend to spend time checking social media rather than doing something collaborative. Our idea is to come up with a simple device that -
1. Can be set up in on a table
2. Supports a simple game
3. Allows any number of people to play
4. Controlled by mobile devices

#### Prototype

#### Current status
We have got our server as well as the mobile frontend working. Next, we'll integrate the circuits with the raspberry pi to make our device.

Here's a link to the working prototype -
