# Interactive tabletop game of tic-tac-toe

#### Team
1. Ankit Malhan
2. Sunny Ladkani

#### Idea
When we are in the social settings, such as a restaurant, we tend to spend time checking social media rather than doing something collaborative. Our idea is to come up with a simple device that -
1. Can be set up in on a table
2. Supports a simple game
3. Allows any number of people to play
4. Controlled by mobile devices

Although controlled by phone, the game is actually played on the device. The simplicity of the game will drive conversations without much distraction. 

#### Prototype

#### Current status
We have got our server as well as the mobile frontend working. Next, we'll integrate the circuits with the raspberry pi to make our device.

Here's a link to the working prototype -

#### Enhancing the experience
1. We'd like to make the device visually appealing, but simplistic. For this, we'll design few prototypes that can be easily printed in the lab.
2. We've not found any usecase of sensors in this project. We have few ideas that we'd like to explore going forward.
